# food-diary

A food diary/tracker application for desktop.

## How it's made
I created a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) database to store the foods. 

I then used the [JDBC API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/index.html) to interface between
the database and the main Java application.

For the GUI, I used [Java FX](https://openjfx.io).
