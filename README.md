My Year 13 A Level Programming Project

A Java Project using JavaFX implemented in a MVC style. 

Copying this project in any future OCR Computer Science A Level Programming Project will be flagged by OCR as plagarism.
So, take inspiration and ideas but don't do the same thing. Or try and do what I did but in a different language e.g Python.
